# [Persian American Student Association's Website](https://pasaatucsd.com)

## Design:

I really like the design language and color schemes from a news website called [Semafor](https://semafor.com). other parts are just me messing around.
In version 2.0 might add some custom made SVGs to spice up the design especially in the header and home part, sth with Iranian color flags and birds maybe

## Frontend:

used **React** and custom react components to write this project.
It was managed using **Vite** and deployed using **Vercel** services.

It only uses client-side routing using `react-router-dom`, might add server side routing in further versions, especially once i figure out routing patterns and things like that, once I figure out if im going to use **Next.js** or not.

## BackEnd:

Currently there is no backend for this app, but in V2.0 might add a custom email list and all the databases that are associated with it :).

start command:
npm run dev
